      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Voices Rising: LGBTQ of Color Arts & Culture is an arts incubator for queer communities of color. We foreground Black,Indigenous, POC/multicultural arts & cuture, and by documenting our shared stories we create repository for that culture. In 2007, Voices Risinig began as a grassrouts cultural organization at Richard Hugo house. Since then we have presented at Langston Hughes Cultural Center, and we are Anchor Tenants at Washington Hall.

We work from an intersectional space, inviting multigenerational wisdom sharing and mentorship. We cultivate health and healing through the arts, for communities that have been deeply impacted by systems of oppression. We have provided nuturance and elevationto many artists of color, including THEESatisfaction, Soulchilde, Dakota, Amber Flame, Justin Huertas and many others. Many have gone on to successful careers in the arts.

In the Two Spirit tradition, we work "to keep the fire lit in the village", meaning our work has existed as a means of community empowerment, healing and evolution. Our mission has always been to be of sercive to our community, and for years this work was volunteer. We welcome your support to continue to serve all of our people.</h5>

      <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">We are in a transformational/evolutionary stage at this moment, currenlty invinting a wider, intergenerational community to share what is most needed, and how we may best be of service. Current plans are ongoing for a Hope Corps project, free to all, focused on BIPO/QTIPOC community led gatherings and offerings, of creative workshops, trainig, opportunities, mentorships, healing modalities, self care, mutual and material aid. We've grown from preseting interdisciplinary performance events, to a uniquely intersectional organization that operates from the Two Spirit philosophy: To keep the fire lit in the village. Our recent project at King county steet station was "Home of Good: A Black Seattle Storyquilt", a yearlong installation of a community-created quilt comosed of photographs of Black life in Seattle's Central District 1900-1990s. Collaborations happend with Goethe Institutes Trainspotting Series, and continue with the community artist Free Egynfemi Bangura and Wa Na Wari.</h5>

  <div class="w3-content">
   
      <h1>Buisness Biography</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Voices Rising: LGBTQ of Color Arts & Culture began as a one-day festival of QTIPOC/BIPOC (queer, trans, intersex, people of color, Black, Indigenous People of Color) arts and culture. Featuring poetry, spoken word, music and dance- the event evolved into a series of events that foregrounded and uplifted the culture of queer people of color. Our founding was in July 2007, at the time we were the first mnaistream, grassroots POC org that uplifted the specific culture. In the 15 years since, we have nurtured the larger culture by lifting early opportunities and mentorship to THEESatisfaction, Chad Goller-Sojourner, Amber Flame, and many others who have continued to contribute to our creative culture. We paid our artists, provided them with cultural production mentorship and video of their performance, free of charge.Much of this was done on a voluntary basis. We excel in : cultural multimedia production, creating meaningful and intersectional community spaces that encourage healing, creativity and caring. We are the most intersectional cultural project in Seattle: we focus on QTIPOC culture, intergenerational and working class culture, mentors and established artists and cross generational knowledge exchanges. For 15 years we have expanded our work, beginning with love and pride in our place in the circle.</h5>
